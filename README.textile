h2. This project is a small part of Flash desktop app that creates custom video players using Robotlegs MVC ("robotlegs.org":http://www.robotlegs.org) framework and Adobe's Open Source Media Framework ("osmf.org":http://www.osmf.org). The core of the code can be found in the "src" directory.

h4. Notes

*This project will not compile as a complete working player*. It is only here to showcase code proficiency. Several proprietary files have been removed. This code is from 2010.

All classes in this project are completely "decoupled", as the intent of the application is to create a customized video player generator with each class being a fully customizable part of the application.
