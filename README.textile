h4. Part of proprietary project. This was for a desktop app that allows you to create and generate custom video players.

h4. Notes

*This project will not compile as a complete working player*. It is only here to showcase code proficiency. Several proprietary files have been removed. This code is from 2010.

All classes in this project are completely "decoupled", as the intent of the application is to create a customized video player generator with each class being a fully customizable part of the application.
